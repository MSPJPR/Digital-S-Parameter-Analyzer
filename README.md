Objective:

This project is a web-based interactive tool designed to calculate and visualize S-parameters (Scattering Parameters) for a given frequency. It allows users to input a frequency value and calculates the S11, S21, S12, and S22 parameters, displaying them both as text and as a dynamic chart.

Features:

1. Interactive User Input:

Users can enter a frequency (in GHz).

The input field is validated to ensure only positive numbers are accepted.



2. S-Parameter Calculation:

The tool calculates:

S11: Reflection coefficient at the input.

S21: Forward transmission coefficient.

S12: Reverse transmission coefficient.

S22: Reflection coefficient at the output.


Calculations use simple mathematical functions to simulate real S-parameter behavior.



3. Dynamic Visualization:

Results are displayed dynamically in a clean, formatted text output.

A responsive line chart powered by Chart.js visualizes the calculated S-parameters.



4. Responsive Design:

The layout adapts for mobile and desktop screens.

Clean and modern UI styled with CSS for better user experience.

Technology Stack:

HTML: Structure of the webpage.

CSS: Styling for layout, input fields, buttons, and output display.

JavaScript: Logic for S-parameter calculations and dynamic chart updates.

Chart.js: Library for plotting S-parameters on a line chart.

How to Use the Tool:

1. Input Frequency:

Enter a frequency value in GHz.



2. Calculate S-Parameters:

Click the "Calculate S-Parameters" button to generate results.



3. View Results:

The S-parameters are displayed in a text format.

The chart updates dynamically to visualize the values.


This tool can serve as an educational resource, helping users understand and visualize S-parameters in real-time.
